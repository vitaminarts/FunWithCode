## fun with code :D
# Script 1 - (PHP - HTML - CSS):

  The result of this code is not an image **:D** but you will see several \<div\> tags that create an image.
  
  By using this script , you are able to see each pixel's **RGB** code just by hovering your pointer on them.
  
  **All you need to do, is replacing "image.jpg" on line 16 with your jpeg or jpg file path and then just run the script :D**
  
  **If you are going to use png files , just replace imagecreatefromjpeg($file_name) on line 17 with imagecreatefrompng($file_name) :D**
  
  As i seid, it's just a funny script.
